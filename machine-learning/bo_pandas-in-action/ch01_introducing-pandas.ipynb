primary data structure in pandas.  \n","It is effectively a table of data with multiple columns.\n","- The `Series` is a one-dimensional labeled array. Think of it as a single column of data.\n","- We can access a row in a `Series` or `DataFrame` by its row number or index label.\n","- We can sort a `DataFrame` by values across one or more columns.\n","- We can use logical conditions to extract subsets of data from a `DataFrame`.\n","- We bucket `DataFrame` rows based on a columnâ€™s values.  \n","We can also perform aggregate operations such as sums on the resulting groups."]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"bo_pandas-in-action","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.18"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2}
