`float weight;`\n","    - previous programs used an integer variable type(`int`)\n","    - but, this program adds a floating-point variable type(`float`)  \n","    $\\rightarrow$ you can handle a wider variety of data  \n","    the `float` type can hold numbers with decimal points  \n","- the program uses some new ways of writing constants  \n","    - `value = 1700.0 * weight * 14.5833;`\n","    - you have numbers with decimal points  \n","- the program prints new kind of variable  \n","    - `printf(\"Your weight in platinum is worth $%.2f.\\n\", value);`\n","    - the program uses the `%f` specifier in the `printf()` to handle a floating-point value\n","    - the `.2` modifier to the `%f` specifier fine-tunes the appearance of the output  \n","    $\\rightarrow$ it displays two places to the right of the decimal  \n","- the program reads values with the `scanf()` function  \n","    - `scanf(\"%f\", &weight);`\n","    - the `scanf()` function provides keyboard input to the program\n","    - the `%f` instructs `scanf()` to read a floating-point number\n","    - the `&weight` tells `scanf()` to assign the input value to the variable named `weight`\n","    - the `scanf()` function uses the `&` notation to indicate where it can find the `weight` variable\n","- these new feature tells that the program is interactive  \n","    - the computer asks you for information and uses it  \n","    - the interactive approach makes programs more flexible  \n","        - ex) the Listing 3.1 can be used for any reasonable weight, not just for sample weight  \n","        $\\therefore$ you don't need to rewrite the program every time you want to try it on a new weight  \n","    - the `scanf()` and `printf()` functions make this interactivity possible  \n","        - the `scanf()` reads data from the keyboard and delivers it to the program  \n","        - the `printf()` reads data from a program and delivers it to the screen  \n","        -

`char`: designates the type used for letters of the alphabet and other characters  \n","    (ex. `#`, `$`, `%`, ...)  \n","        - also can be used to represent small integers  \n","    - `float`, `double`, `long double`: used to reppresent numbers with decimal points  \n","    - `_Bool`: for Boolean values  \n","    (ex. `true`, `false`)  \n","    - `_Complex`, `_Imaginary`: represent complex and imaginary numbers, respectively  \n","- the types created with these keywords can be divided into two families:  \n","    -
