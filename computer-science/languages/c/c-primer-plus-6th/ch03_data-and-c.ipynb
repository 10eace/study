typically, `int` uses one machine word for storage  \n","    $\\rightarrow$ current personal computers typically use 32-bit integers  \n","    - ISO C sepcifies that the minumum range of `int` should be -32767 to 32767\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","##### Declaring an `int` Variable  \n","- keyword `int` is used to declare the basic integer variable  \n","- ex) `int num;`  \n","- to declare more than one variable,  \n","    - you can declare each variable separately  \n","    ex) `int num1; int num2; int num3;`\n","    - you can follow the `int` with a list of names separated by commas  \n","    ex) `int num1, num2, num3;`\n","- the declaration of variables performs:  \n","    -

it means to assign it a starting, or initial, value  \n","    - in C, initialization can be done as part of declaration  \n","    - ex) `int num = 5;`, `int num1 = 5, num2 = 10;`, `int num1, num2 = 10;`  \n","    - in the last example, only `num2` is initialized to 10  \n","    it can be seem that `num1` is also initialized to 10  \n","    $\\therefore$ it is best to avoid putting initialized and noninitialized variables in the same declaration  \n","\n","<br>\n","\n","##### Type `int` Constants  \n","- *integer constants*: 1, 2, 21, 32, 14, 94, ...  \n","- it is also called *integer literals*  \n","- a number without:  \n","    -
